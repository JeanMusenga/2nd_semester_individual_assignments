Also I would like to know what is standard/preferred way to create an infrastructure in AWS for such services.\\n\",\n          \"I'm trying to properly design an application according to clean architecture, but I'm struggling to determine on which layer (data/domain) to implement certain logic. In my application, there's a feature that displays data (user contacts) which can be either set locally in settings or retrieved through an API. Which version to show the user depends on other settings and the app's usage mode, for example, the API returns data, but the user has set a preference for using local data in the app's settings. On which layer should I implement the logic for choosing the data source?\\nLet's say there is a GetUserContactsUseCase in the domain.\\nThen, as I understand it, there are several approaches:\\n<strong>Approach 1</strong>\\nUserRepository, which contains 2 sources:\\nLocalData - contains all local settings, such as contact data and priority settings.\\nRemoteData - loads and caches data from the API.\\nGetUserContactsUseCase accesses RemoteData and LocalData (which apparently need to be renamed to RemoteDataRepository and LocalDataRepository), determines the priorities, and then fetches the data from them. The downside of this solution is that it seems the Repository should be determining the data source itself.\\n<strong>Approach 2</strong>\\nUserRepository independently determines the priority. This maintains encapsulation of layers, but in this case, UserRepository contains business logic that seems like it should be in a UseCase, not a repository. It is also not possible to call a UseCase from a repository. One solution seems to be writing a separate UseCase to determine the source of UserContacts and pass its result (e.g., UserContactFetchMode) to UserRepository. This UseCase still leads back to approach 1 as it will need the same LocalData and RemoteData.\\n<strong>Question:</strong>\\nPlease advise on the best way to organize this.\\nI'm not sure if it's relevant to my question, but I suspect there is some confusion in the level of function distribution among the Repositories themselves, for instance, instead of having a single LocalPreferences, it might be necessary to create several instances, like LocalUserData, LocalPreferencesData, etc.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_scores\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2.0014830212433605e-16,\n        \"min\": 0.9998365271733075,\n        \"max\": 0.999836527173308,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9998365271733077,\n          0.999836527173308,\n          0.9998365271733075\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answer_body\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"<blockquote>\\ntl;dr: Spring MVC will not contradict what you are trying to do, but as a technology this is not the main scenario it was built for.\\n</blockquote>\\nFirst a short terminology clarification (a bit pedantic, but precision helps for the understanding):\\n\\nI think when you say &quot;Microservice&quot;, you mean &quot;<em>one</em> RESTful service, as part of your backend&quot;. The term &quot;<em>Microservices</em>&quot; is usually only used in plural, referring to the structural patter of having multiple REST services at interplay in a backend.\\n\\nCan / should you use Spring MVC for the scenario in mind?\\n\\nThe strong point of Spring MVC is a convenient exchange of variables between the static, server side created HTML pages (<strong>V</strong>) and the backend (<strong>C+M</strong>). E.g. a HTML form, where Spring MVC gives you convenient access to form fields, directly from your java code. The communication you describe (your frontend interacting with a REST API) is not part of this main Spring MVC purpose. However, Spring MVC is not per se ruling out the scenario you have in mind. HTML pages generated by Spring MVC may still contain code that fires requests to a REST API backend.\\n\\nHow is this usually done:\\n\\nThe communication of a web frontend with a REST backend usually works like this: Some JavaScript code, which is running on the client / frontend side issues <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noreferrer\\\">fetch</a> calls to send HTTP requests to the RESTful service / backend. The Javascript code (or rather the page containing the JavaScript code) can be delivered from anywhere. It can be part of your Spring MVC application, but you do not need Spring MVC to deliver webpages.\\n\\n<blockquote>\\nConcerning your last question: You can of course use React etc on client side, to issue requests to the API. But basic JavaScript will perfectly get the job done. In fact, adding a huge client side framework might likely add unnecessary complexity. I'd go with simple basic technologies, unless you have a strong reason / need to add a client sided framework. Similarly, the logic residing on the backend is not tied to Spring MVC as a backend technology. Any basic REST API can encapsulate backend logic.\\n</blockquote>\\n\",\n          \"Short answer is: no, you don't have to but you probably should.\\nUsually, EKS would be deployed in a private VPC and, even if you can make it public in other ways, a VPC link from the API gateway and network/application load balancer is probably the safest way.\\nImagine the case where someone deploys an insecure service in EKS. If you expose the cluster, you risk having security issues. Again, there are ways to secure the Kubernetes cluster for those cases as well. It would also facilitate SSL (in addition to the feature you already listed).\\nI would say that you best practice in AWS would be to use API gateway for authentication and your micro services as resources where you check the auth (in Cognito f.ex.).\\nThat being said, that would make you project AWS dependent.\\nAlternative would be to implement your own gateway and security in your Kubernetes cluster which could be done with a service mesh like Istio or similar.\\nIn any cases, don't do security at the services level only. You can never assume that all services will be secured.\\n\",\n          \"Determining the source of the information is business logic, not data-access logic.  The logic does not belong in the Repository, it belongs in the UseCase.  Your repositories might return the same model, and even implement the same interfaces, but the fact that it needs to be selectable means you have business-logic involved which belongs in the UseCase.\\nBy moving the selection logic to the UseCase, you can let your repositories stay dumb, and only worry about the communication to their data-stores.\\nThis &quot;feels&quot; wrong as it seems like a separation-of-concerns issue, but it isn't.   They are different concerns BECAUSE they have the business logic to switch between them.  Put in an interface for RemoteUserContactsData and LocalUserContactsData and push the switching into the UseCase and it will become fairly obvious.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_scores\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9.614813431917819e-17,\n        \"min\": 0.9998365271733074,\n        \"max\": 0.9998365271733076,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9998365271733074,\n          0.9998365271733076,\n          0.9998365271733075\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In my application, there's a feature that displays data (user contacts) which can be either set locally in settings or retrieved through an API. Which version to show the user depends on other settings and the app's usage mode, for example, the API returns data, but the user has set a preference for using local data in the app's settings. On which layer should I implement the logic for choosing the data source?\\nLet's say there is a GetUserContactsUseCase in the domain.\\nThen, as I understand it, there are several approaches:\\n<strong>Approach 1</strong>\\nUserRepository, which contains 2 sources:\\nLocalData - contains all local settings, such as contact data and priority settings.\\nRemoteData - loads and caches data from the API.\\nGetUserContactsUseCase accesses RemoteData and LocalData (which apparently need to be renamed to RemoteDataRepository and LocalDataRepository), determines the priorities, and then fetches the data from them. The downside of this solution is that it seems the Repository should be determining the data source itself.\\n<strong>Approach 2</strong>\\nUserRepository independently determines the priority. This maintains encapsulation of layers, but in this case, UserRepository contains business logic that seems like it should be in a UseCase, not a repository. It is also not possible to call a UseCase from a repository. One solution seems to be writing a separate UseCase to determine the source of UserContacts and pass its result (e.g., UserContactFetchMode) to UserRepository. This UseCase still leads back to approach 1 as it will need the same LocalData and RemoteData.\\n<strong>Question:</strong>\\nPlease advise on the best way to organize this.\\nI'm not sure if it's relevant to my question, but I suspect there is some confusion in the level of function distribution among the Repositories themselves, for instance, instead of having a single LocalPreferences, it might be necessary to create several instances, like LocalUserData, LocalPreferencesData, etc.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"If I use Spring MVC for designing the client side application, and from there, the client side application sends requests to the microservices REST APIs to use their services, is this a standard and correct solution?\\nI mean, designing the client side app using Spring MVC instead of frameworks like angular or react.

The term &quot;<em>Microservices</em>&quot; is usually only used in plural, referring to the structural patter of having multiple REST services at interplay in a backend.\\n\\nCan / should you use Spring MVC for the scenario in mind?\\n\\nThe strong point of Spring MVC is a convenient exchange of variables between the static, server side created HTML pages (<strong>V</strong>) and the backend (<strong>C+M</strong>). E.g. a HTML form, where Spring MVC gives you convenient access to form fields, directly from your java code. The communication you describe (your frontend interacting with a REST API) is not part of this main Spring MVC purpose. However, Spring MVC is not per se ruling out the scenario you have in mind. HTML pages generated by Spring MVC may still contain code that fires requests to a REST API backend.\\n\\nHow is this usually done:\\n\\nThe communication of a web frontend with a REST backend usually works like this: Some JavaScript code, which is running on the client / frontend side issues <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noreferrer\\\">fetch</a> calls to send HTTP requests to the RESTful service / backend. The Javascript code (or rather the page containing the JavaScript code) can be delivered from anywhere. It can be part of your Spring MVC application, but you do not need Spring MVC to deliver webpages.\\n\\n<blockquote>\\nConcerning your last question: You can of course use React etc on client side, to issue requests to the API. But basic JavaScript will perfectly get the job done. In fact, adding a huge client side framework might likely add unnecessary complexity. I'd go with simple basic technologies, unless you have a strong reason / need to add a client sided framework. Similarly, the logic residing on the backend is not tied to Spring MVC as a backend technology. Any basic REST API can encapsulate backend logic.\\n</blockquote>\\n\",\n          \"Short answer is: no, you don't have to but you probably should.\\nUsually, EKS would be deployed in a private VPC and, even if you can make it public in other ways, a VPC link from the API gateway and network/application load balancer is probably the safest way.\\nImagine the case where someone deploys an insecure service in EKS. If you expose the cluster, you risk having security issues. Again, there are ways to secure the Kubernetes cluster for those cases as well. It would also facilitate SSL (in addition to the feature you already listed).\\nI would say that you best practice in AWS would be to use API gateway for authentication and your micro services as resources where you check the auth (in Cognito f.ex.).\\nThat being said, that would make you project AWS dependent.\\nAlternative would be to implement your own gateway and security in your Kubernetes cluster which could be done with a service mesh like Istio or similar.\\nIn any cases, don't do security at the services level only. You can never assume that all services will be secured.\\n\",\n          \"Determining the source of the information is business logic, not data-access logic.  The logic does not belong in the Repository, it belongs in the UseCase.  Your repositories might return the same model, and even implement the same interfaces, but the fact that it needs to be selectable means you have business-logic involved which belongs in the UseCase.\\nBy moving the selection logic to the UseCase, you can let your repositories stay dumb, and only worry about the communication to their data-stores.\\nThis &quot;feels&quot; wrong as it seems like a separation-of-concerns issue, but it isn't.   They are different concerns BECAUSE they have the business logic to switch between them.  Put in an interface for RemoteUserContactsData and LocalUserContactsData and push the switching into the UseCase and it will become fairly obvious.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"It can be part of your Spring MVC application, but you do not need Spring MVC to deliver webpages.\\n\\n The strong point of Spring MVC is a convenient exchange of variables between the static, server side created HTML pages (<strong>V</strong>) and the backend (<strong>C+M</strong>).
