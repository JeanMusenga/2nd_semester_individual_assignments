There is no native WCF solution that I know that can solve the state management issue. I have even looked into durable services, where state management is handled by WCF, however not suitable for a pub/ sub service, because the state needs to be centralized for all client connections.

That is, for example, break the employe table down in to employee_info, employee_contact_info, employee_assignments, and then provide the legacy application with a view named employee that does a join across these three tables (or maybe a table-based function if the logic is more complex).  This would potentially allow you to move ahead with a fully ORM-based solution which is what I would prefer and keep your legacy application happy.  I would not proceed with a mixed solution of ORM/direct SQL, although you might be able to augment your ORM by having some entity classes which provide different views of the same data (say a join across a couple of tables for read-only display).\n",

            "Then you want to have another layer that defines the \"business logic\"; i.e. the interaction of your data with your data.  This has to do with things such as how the Account interacts with the User, etc.  The encapsulation here basically takes care of your high-level interactions.  In this way, you can define the abstractions that make the most sense for your business requirements without needing to depend on implementation; for example, you can define a \"UserAccount\" Model, that will do all the things that you need to do to handle User Accounts; define all the things that you want that abstraction to do.  Then, once you've got that abstraction down, that is your Model; you can then define, in the internal workings of that model, how the interactions occur with your persistence code.\n",

            "In this way, you abstract out the <strong>persistence</strong> and <strong>implementation</strong> of your Model from the actual Model <strong>interface</strong>.  So you can define your model as doing the things you want it to do without concern for the underlying implementation.  The benefits of this are significant; the process of thinking about what you want your Model to do, in isolation from the way in which it will be doing it, can be very instructional; as well, if your backing data layer changes, your Model doesn't need to change; so you can prototype with a flat file, for example.\n",

So one would assume that these companies have a hardware based load balancer like BigIP, Netscaler or something like that, which is the sole device behind the single IP address of that site. This load balancer would decrypt the SSL (if encoded), inspect the cookie and decide depending on the session id of that cookie which application server holds the session of that customer.\n",

            " \u001b[33mAnswer:\u001b[37m The largest commonality you'll find in functional languages is using functions to store data. It's a bit like using accessor functions on an object without the object. Instead, the function is created in an environment where it has access to the data it needs. Now this function can be passed and used anywhere and still retain the ability to use the data.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a very simple example. This isn't purely functional as it does change state, but it's common enough:\n",

            "      count)))\n",

            "(define x (make-counter))\n",
